// Package jrnl is the top-level journal API.
//
// It provides atomic operations that are buffered locally and manipulate
// objects via buffers of type *buf.Buf.
//
// The caller uses this interface by beginning an operation Op,
// reading/writing within the transaction, and finally committing the buffered
// transaction.
//
// Note that while the API has reads and writes, these are not the usual database
// read/write transactions. Only writes are made atomic and visible atomically;
// reads are cached on first read. Thus to use this library the file
// system in practice locks (sub-block) objects before using them in an
// operation. This is necessary so that loaded objects are read from a consistent
// view.
//
// Operations support asynchronous durability by setting wait=false in
// CommitWait, which results in an "unstable" operation. An unstable operation is
// made visible atomically to other threads, including across crashes, but if the
// system crashes the latest unstable operations can be lost. To guarantee that a
// particular operation is durable, call Flush on the underlying *obj.Log (which
// flushes all transactions).
//
// Objects have sizes. Implicit in the code is that there is a static "schema"
// that determines the disk layout: each block has objects of a particular size,
// and all sizes used fit an integer number of objects in a block. This schema
// guarantees that objects never overlap, as long as operations involving an
// addr.Addr use the correct size for that block number.
//
// A file system can realize this schema fairly simply, since the disk is
// partitioned into inodes, data blocks, and bitmap allocators for each (sized
// appropriately), all allocated statically.
